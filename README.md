# MY-FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT---Vector-Autoregression-to-Forecast-Churn-based-on-Steam-Review
For my degree final year project, i designed and developed a churn forecasting model using vector autoregression with sentiment analysis based on Steam review.

Churn is the act of customer to stop using service/product, it is a challenge that all businesses face.
Using sentiment is proven by previous researcher to be an insight to prediction. Therefore there was a need to use sentiment analysis based on Steam to forecast churn in a timeseries manner.

*The model is fully developed using Python with Jupyer Notebook*

The full report is available as "FYP FULL REPORT", whereas the other files are required for the phyton program to be working
